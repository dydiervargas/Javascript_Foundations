JavaScript Paradigm.
❖ Event-driven
Is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user
actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or
threads. Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and
other applications that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input.
❖ Functional
Is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It
is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map
values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running
state of the program.
❖ Imperative
Is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same
way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program
consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing
how a program operates.
